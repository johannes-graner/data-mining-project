# data-mining-project

This repository contains an implementation of the FROCC algorithm.

## How to run

The algorithm is implemented in Python, using Jupyter Notebooks. The recommended way to run the code in the repository is with the `jupyter/scipy-notebook` Docker container. A script (`launch-jupyter.sh`) is provided in the code directory for starting the Docker container with appropriate parameters.

## Dependencies

When running Jupyter through the recommended Docker container, all dependencies are automatically included. Otherwise, the following libraries need to be installed.

* Numpy
* Scipy
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn
